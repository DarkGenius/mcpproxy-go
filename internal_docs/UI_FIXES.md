# MCPProxy Web UI - QA Testing Results

## Testing Overview

**Date:** 2025-09-20
**Tester:** QA Testing with Playwright
**Environment:** MCPProxy v0.1.0 running on localhost:8080
**Browser:** Chromium via Playwright
**Test Scope:** Complete UI functionality audit

## Executive Summary

The MCPProxy web UI provides a solid foundation with responsive design and proper navigation structure. However, several critical issues were identified that affect user experience and functionality completeness.

**Overall Status:** üü° **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- ‚úÖ Basic navigation and routing work
- ‚úÖ Responsive design implemented
- ‚úÖ Clean, professional UI design
- ‚ùå Multiple incomplete pages
- ‚ùå Grammar/text issues
- ‚ùå Missing critical functionality

## Issues Found

### üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. Incomplete Page Implementations
**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Major functionality gaps
**Pages Affected:** Tools, Search, Settings

**Details:**
- **Tools Page** (`/ui/tools`): Shows "This page is coming soon!" placeholder
- **Search Page** (`/ui/search`): Shows "This page is coming soon!" placeholder
- **Settings Page** (`/ui/settings`): Shows "This page is coming soon!" placeholder

**Expected Behavior:**
- Tools page should display available MCP tools with filtering/search
- Search page should provide BM25 search across all tools
- Settings page should allow configuration of MCPProxy preferences

**Screenshots:**
- Tools page placeholder (all three pages have identical placeholder UI)

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 2. Grammar Error in Empty State Message
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Poor user experience, unprofessional appearance
**Location:** Servers page empty state

**Current Text:** "No all servers available"
**Correct Text:** "No servers available"

**File:** `frontend/src/views/Servers.vue` (likely)
**Screenshot:** Available in `/servers-page.png`

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 3. System Status Display Issues
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Confusing status information
**Location:** Dashboard and header status indicators

**Issues:**
- Dashboard shows status as "Stopped" but server is clearly running
- Header shows "Stopped" with "0/0 servers"
- "Real-time Updates: Connected" but "Status: Stopped" is contradictory

**Expected Behavior:**
- Status should reflect actual server state (Running/Stopped)
- Connected servers count should be accurate
- Real-time status should be consistent across components

#### 4. Console Errors in Browser
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Potential functionality issues
**Details:**

Browser console shows:
- `[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)`
- SSE connection established but some resources failing to load

**Investigation Needed:** Check for missing static assets or API endpoints

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 5. Empty State Messaging Consistency
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Minor UX inconsistency

**Dashboard:**
- Shows "No servers connected" with "Manage Servers" button (good)

**Servers Page:**
- Shows "No servers found" with "No all servers available" (needs fix)

**Recommendation:** Standardize empty state messaging and CTAs across all pages.

## Screenshots & Evidence

- `dashboard-overview.png` - Main dashboard view
- `servers-page.png` - Shows the grammar error in empty state
- `mobile-view.png` - Demonstrates responsive design

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix the grammar error (1 line change)
2. **Sprint Planning:** Prioritize Tools and Search page implementation
3. **Status Logic Review:** Investigate and fix status display inconsistencies
4. **Full Integration Testing:** Test with actual MCP servers connected

## Technical Notes

- Vue.js frontend with TypeScript
- API integration appears properly structured
- SSE implementation working
- Router configuration is correct
- Component architecture looks sound

The foundation is solid, but critical functionality needs completion before production deployment.
