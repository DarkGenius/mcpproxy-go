# Phase 5: Cleanup & Observability - COMPLETE

## Overview
Phase 5 completes the refactoring series by adding comprehensive observability metrics for supervisors and actors, updating architecture documentation, and documenting the migration path for future work.

## Implementation Details

### Observability Metrics
Enhanced `internal/observability/metrics.go` with supervisor and actor-specific metrics:

#### Supervisor Metrics (New)
```go
// Reconciliation tracking
mcpproxy_supervisor_reconciliations_total{result}
    - Labels: result (success, failed)
    - Type: Counter
    - Purpose: Track reconciliation cycle outcomes

mcpproxy_supervisor_reconciliation_duration_seconds
    - Type: Histogram
    - Buckets: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]
    - Purpose: Measure reconciliation latency

mcpproxy_supervisor_state_changes_total{server, from_state, to_state}
    - Labels: server, from_state, to_state
    - Type: Counter
    - Purpose: Track server state transitions
```

#### Actor Metrics (New)
```go
// Actor lifecycle tracking
mcpproxy_actor_state_transitions_total{server, from_state, to_state}
    - Labels: server, from_state, to_state
    - Type: Counter
    - Purpose: Track actor state machine transitions

mcpproxy_actor_connect_duration_seconds{server, result}
    - Labels: server, result (success, failed)
    - Type: Histogram
    - Buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60]
    - Purpose: Measure connection establishment time

mcpproxy_actor_retries_total{server}
    - Labels: server
    - Type: Counter
    - Purpose: Count retry attempts per server

mcpproxy_actor_failures_total{server, error_type}
    - Labels: server, error_type
    - Type: Counter
    - Purpose: Track failure reasons
```

### Recording Methods

#### Supervisor Metrics
```go
// Record reconciliation outcome
metrics.RecordReconciliation(result string, duration time.Duration)

// Record server state changes
metrics.RecordServerStateChange(server, fromState, toState string)
```

#### Actor Metrics
```go
// Record state transitions
metrics.RecordActorStateTransition(server, fromState, toState string)

// Record connection attempts
metrics.RecordActorConnect(server, result string, duration time.Duration)

// Record retries
metrics.RecordActorRetry(server string)

// Record failures
metrics.RecordActorFailure(server, errorType string)
```

### Architecture Documentation

Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` with comprehensive Phase 3-5 section:

**New Content**:
- Overview of lock-free architecture refactoring
- Phase 3: Actor Model architecture and benefits
- Phase 4: StateView read model and performance
- Phase 5: Observability metrics and usage
- Before/After comparison showing improvements
- Migration status and future work
- Testing & verification results
- Performance benchmarks

**Key Sections**:
1. **Actor Architecture**: State machines, concurrency safety, performance
2. **StateView Architecture**: Lock-free reads, copy-on-write updates, memory characteristics
3. **Supervisor Integration**: Event flow, update paths
4. **Observability**: New metrics, usage examples
5. **Migration Status**: What's complete, in progress, and future work

### Deprecated Methods

**Status**: Kept for backward compatibility

The following deprecated methods remain in the codebase:
- `runtime.Config()` - Used by server, httpapi, lifecycle
- `runtime.cfg` field - Internal pointer for compatibility

**Rationale**:
- Full Actor integration not yet complete (Supervisor still uses upstream.Manager)
- HTTP API not yet migrated to StateView
- Removing now would break existing functionality

**Future Work**:
Once Actors are fully integrated and HTTP API uses StateView:
1. Migrate all `runtime.Config()` calls to `runtime.ConfigSnapshot()`
2. Remove deprecated methods and fields
3. Update all consumers to use lock-free accessors

## Testing & Verification

### Test Results

**Full Internal Suite**:
```bash
go test ./internal/... -race -timeout=2m -skip '^Test(E2E_|Binary|MCPProtocol)'
# All packages PASS
# Race detector: No races detected
```

**Key Package Results**:
- `internal/observability`: No test files (build verified)
- `internal/runtime/stateview`: PASS (cached)
- `internal/runtime/supervisor`: PASS (cached)
- `internal/runtime/supervisor/actor`: PASS (cached)
- `internal/httpapi`: PASS - 1.270s
- `internal/server`: PASS - 1.454s
- `internal/tray`: PASS - 1.519s

### Build Verification
```bash
go build ./internal/observability/...
# SUCCESS - All new metrics compile correctly
```

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs
- ✅ Deprecated methods still functional
- ✅ Zero test failures or regressions

## Metrics Integration Examples

### Supervisor Integration (Future)
```go
func (s *Supervisor) reconcile(configSnapshot *configsvc.Snapshot) error {
    start := time.Now()

    // Perform reconciliation
    err := s.doReconciliation(configSnapshot)

    // Record metrics
    result := "success"
    if err != nil {
        result = "failed"
    }
    s.metrics.RecordReconciliation(result, time.Since(start))

    return err
}
```

### Actor Integration (Future)
```go
func (a *Actor) handleConnect() {
    start := time.Now()

    // Record state transition
    a.metrics.RecordActorStateTransition(
        a.config.ServerName,
        string(a.GetState()),
        string(StateConnecting)
    )

    // Attempt connection
    err := a.client.Connect(a.ctx)

    // Record result
    result := "success"
    if err != nil {
        result = "failed"
        a.metrics.RecordActorFailure(
            a.config.ServerName,
            classifyError(err)
        )
    }
    a.metrics.RecordActorConnect(
        a.config.ServerName,
        result,
        time.Since(start)
    )
}
```

### Retry Tracking (Future)
```go
func (a *Actor) scheduleRetry() {
    // Record retry attempt
    a.metrics.RecordActorRetry(a.config.ServerName)

    // Wait and retry
    time.Sleep(a.config.RetryInterval)
    a.SendCommand(Command{Type: CommandConnect})
}
```

## Prometheus Queries

## Migration Path

### Completed (Phase 0-5)
1. ✅ Baseline audit and benchmarks
2. ✅ ConfigService with lock-free reads
3. ✅ Supervisor with state reconciliation
4. ✅ Actor model with per-server goroutines
5. ✅ StateView read model
6. ✅ Observability metrics

### Remaining Work

#### 1. Full Actor Integration
**Current**: Supervisor uses upstream.Manager directly
**Target**: Supervisor creates and manages Actors

**Steps**:
- Create Actor instances in Supervisor.Start()
- Replace upstream calls with Actor commands
- Subscribe to Actor events for state updates
- Update StateView from Actor events

**Impact**: Enables all actor metrics, completes state machine vision

#### 2. HTTP API Migration
**Current**: `handleGetServers()` calls controller methods
**Target**: `handleGetServers()` reads from StateView

**Steps**:
- Change `controller.GetAllServers()` to `supervisor.StateView().Snapshot()`
- Remove BoltDB queries from hot paths
- Keep BoltDB for history/audit only
- Add caching layer if needed

**Impact**: Reduces read latency, removes DB contention

#### 3. Tray Real-Time Updates
**Current**: Tray polls via HTTP every N seconds
**Target**: Tray subscribes to SSE events

**Steps**:
- Connect to `/events` SSE endpoint
- Subscribe to `servers.changed` events
- Update UI on state change events
- Remove polling logic

**Impact**: Real-time UI updates, reduced network traffic

#### 4. Deprecated Method Removal
**Current**: Deprecated methods still in use
**Target**: All code uses lock-free accessors

**Steps**:
- Migrate all `runtime.Config()` calls
- Remove deprecated methods
- Update tests
- Verify no regressions

**Impact**: Cleaner codebase, enforced best practices

#### 5. Grafana Dashboards
**Current**: Metrics defined but no dashboards
**Target**: Production-ready monitoring

**Components**:
- Supervisor health dashboard
- Actor performance dashboard
- Connection latency heatmaps
- Error rate panels
- Alerting rules

**Impact**: Production observability
